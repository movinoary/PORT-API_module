# API MODULE

I created this API to make it easier for me to create something on various websites that I will create. So just call the API, no need to copy-paste from the previous code. Make the repo that will be created minimalist. Here I use python as the programming language and flask as the framework.

## Running

run it with the following code

#### `flask --app main run --debug --port 5020`
